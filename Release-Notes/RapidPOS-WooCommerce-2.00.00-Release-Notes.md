# Rapid POS WooCommerce Connector v2.00.00 Release Notes

_Release Date: October 28, 2025_

## New Functionality

### Moved the connector to the CI/CD pipeline

- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. Previously, when a new feature was developed or a bug was fixed, we would have to manually perform a re-install of that connector at every client. CI/CD means the fixes and new features are automatically deployed, sometimes fixing a bug before you ever experience it.
